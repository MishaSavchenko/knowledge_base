[[Dependency Injection]]


Thoughts: 
	Groot: visualizer for behavior trees can be leveraged for debugging purposes
		groot is not very visuallizy 
	each button in the ui_builder can be assosciated with a specific behavior 
		is that assumption technically true? 
			since some actions need to be confirmed by the user some of them must have user input to fail or succeed 
	wrapping up RPC within the behavior trees might be complicated
