[Mobile Camera Positioning to Optimize the Observability of Human Activity Recognition Tasks ][http://vision.psych.umn.edu/users/schrater/Papers/Bodoretal05.pdf]
* observability has different definitions depending on the context, what is the context here?
*  "joint observability of a set of tasks"
	* the implication specific tasks need to be definined in order to optimize obeservability
		* how are tasks in observability space defined/formulated?
			* "path distribution for the are of interest"
				* optimization based on the area of interest
			* 
* base assumption is static mounting of the camera
	* what happens when the camera is mounted on the arms itself
* [[Art Gallery Problem]]
* this paper is trying to capture motion of the environment and figure out the best position for the robot in the world to observe that environment
