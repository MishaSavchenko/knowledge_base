[Perlin Noise Algorithm](https://rtouti.github.io/graphics/perlin-noise-algorithm)
- procedural generation
- distinction between 
	- value noise
	- simplex noise 
	- classic pelin noise 
	- improved perlin noise.
- perlin noise algorithm takes in the dimensions as parameters 
	- dimension parameters
	- iterate over the product of the dimensions and call a noise function to generate a map
- the property of noise function is that if the function is called for adjacent/near by coordinates, the results are close in value 
- get the input point
	- identify 4 points on the grid belonging to the point
	- generate a value using dot product between 2 vectors  
		- noise generators use pseudo random value
	- 
- Perlin noise work of the principle of shared knowledge, by having a central data store where the global points are already defined the algorithm is able to parallelize the process and reach the constraints necessary for generating *continuous* values.
- The *randomness* of the noise generator comes from shuffling the list of permutations
