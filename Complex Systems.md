[Working on Complex Systems][https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/complex-systems]

Distinction between complicated and complex systems: 
* Complicated -> intricate but predictable
	* structured, repeatable solutions
* Complex -> intricate but unique
	* adaptive, and novel solutions
> [!question] Does distinguishing between complex and complicated problems allow for better estimation of how difficult the problem is to solve.
	> If applying common solutions to complex problems can result in ineffective results then the answer is yes

 * If solutions exists, and if they are readily available, they are more likely to be complicated rather than complex
> [!question] Is complicated <-> complex a spectrum? are they mutually exclusive characteristics? >[[answer]]
## Characteristics of Complex System
* Emergent behavior
	* if the individual components interact with each other in an unpredictable way this may create emergent behavior which is difficult to track, but also difficult to analyze 
	* 
* Delayed consequences 
* Local vs Global Optimization
* Hystersis
* Non-linearity
